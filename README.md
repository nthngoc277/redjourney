# introduction

This is a simple project that I used to try to integrate Rails + ReactJS + GraphQL.

About the idea, I found it on the way I try to get out of depression and improve myself. It is meditation, do one thing at a time and do it good, take note the thing I have learnt, the thing I am grateful for.

# Main Features

- Create goal ( it is encourged to just do 1 goal at a time)

- Take note the difficulty, the things are learnt while doing the goal.

- Public the goal if we want to share it with others after finished it.

- Take note the thing that we are grateful for.

- Take note the thing that we have learnt.

# How to run

Run frontend: `yarn start`

Run backend:

- cd to `server` folder
- `bundle install`
- `rake db:setup`
- `rails s -p 3007`


# Takeaways ( about coding )

+ Type is defined in Backend can pass directly from front end when sending the query.
